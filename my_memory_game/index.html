		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>In the Matching Game, you are presented with an array of face-down cards. The array is composed of pairs of matching cards, but the cards are placed randomly. The object of the game is to find the match for every card. Each turn you choose two cards to turn over - if the cards are a match then you remove them from the board, but if the cards don't match then you turn them face down again. The trick is to remember where the first card was when you come across its match elsewhere on the board.</p>
